# CSP-rs

This is a very small rust crate to help avoid typos when creating a **C**ontent-**S**ecurity-**P**olicy string.

Any contributions to improve it are welcome, but keep in mind that the goal of this crate is to be very minimal, and without dependencies.
This should be kept simple enough that anyone who decides to use this care would do so with the confidence that they could maintain it themselves if needed.
